## About the martial art

Naginata is a weapon made of a long wooden stick on which a curved blade is attached.

The art of using this weapon is often called simply as Naginata, but more accurately
it can be called as Atarashii Naginata, in the case of the post-Meiji era standarsised
version.

The method of using naginata as a weapon has existed much longer and some around 500 styles
have existed in the past.

Today these are still some ten active style, of which most of them contain other weapons
aside using just a naginata. In any case in these styles naginata is used against a sword.

This website will focus on the following two:

 * Atarashii Naginatado (http://naginata.jp/)
 * Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu (http://www.jikishin-naginata.jp/)

## History

Versions before 0.4.0 were using PHP as the backend and content editing was done at the site, after
OpenID based login. Content was stored as HTML5 in MySQL database.

From version 0.4.0 onward, the site is running with Node.js and thus JavaScript as the backend.
Content is at the source code repository in text files in Markdown format.

PHP version was made to match the same simplified functionality as the Node.js counterpart in 0.4.1.
