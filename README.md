## About the martial art

Naginata is a weapon made of a long wooden stick on which a curved blade is attached.

The art of using this weapon is often called simply as Naginata, but more accurately
it can be called as Atarashii Naginata, in the case of the post-Meiji era standardised
version.

The method of using naginata as a weapon has existed much longer and some around 500 styles
have existed in the past.

Today these are still some ten active style, of which most of them contain other weapons
aside using just a naginata. In any case in these styles naginata is used against a sword.

This website will focus on the following two:

 * Atarashii Naginata (http://naginata.jp/)
 * Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu (http://www.jikishin-naginata.jp/)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

## Testing

Unit tests for both front end and back end are using Jasmine and for code coverage Istanbul.

```sh
grunt test
npm run coveralls
```

Web performance tests are done with...

```sh
sitespeed.io -u http://naginata.fi -k true -d 2

gem install wbench
wbench -n http://naginata.fi > wbench.md
```

Style coverage is measured with several tools:

* https://github.com/katiefenn/parker

```sh
npm install -g ucss
ucss

npm install -g stylestats
stylestats -t html public_html/css/main.css > stylestats.html

npm install -g parker
parker public_html/css/main.css > parker.md
```

Also [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/ "Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server"):

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon server.js
```

Automated screenshot of the front page on every [deployment with GhostInspector](https://ghostinspector.com/docs/integration/#heroku).

```sh
heroku addons:add deployhooks:http --url=https://api.ghostinspector.com/v1/suites/[suite-id]/execute/?apiKey=[api-key]
```

The free plan of GhostInspector limits running the tests only up to 100 timer per month, hence it is much more efficient
to execute them only on deployment, instead of once a day.

## History

Versions before 0.4.0 were using PHP as the backend and content editing was done at the site, after
OpenID based login. Content was stored as HTML5 in MySQL database.

From version 0.4.0 onward, the site is running with Node.js and thus JavaScript as the backend.
Content is at the source code repository in text files in Markdown format.

PHP version was made to match the same simplified functionality as the Node.js counterpart in 0.4.1.

Around the release of 0.6.0, the actual `naginata.fi` domain was moved to Heroku and served from there with Node.js.
