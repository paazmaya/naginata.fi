# Grading Rules

> Finnish Kendo Association - Atarashii Naginata

> Jukka Paasonen - 1st Sep 2013

Atarashii Naginata grading rules are consistent with the rules of the
European Naginata Federation and the International Naginata Federation.
Among the other martial arts in the Finnish Kendo Association,
the requirements regarding the grading panel are slightly different,
while less demanding for lower grades, more demanding for the first kyu grade.

For those parts that are not mentioned in this document,
the general grading rules of FKA will be followed.

The grading panel will consist of three or five judges.
The majority will be in favour of a candidate's throughput.
In the provision of values 6-2 kyu,
at least one member of the panel must be at least _shodan_.
In the case of promoting to first kyu grade,
at least three of the panel members must be at least _sandan_.

The candidate's enrolment is required with the following information:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Club
* Current grade and date when passed
* Referrer.

The grading fee are collected after the grading, in accordance with the FKA grading fees.
In year 2013: EUR 20 per each passed grade.

For grading abroad, a signed permission from the Finnish Kendo Association is required.
