Jikishinkageryū Naginatajutsu is one of the biggest styles that are still being
practised,in which the naginata is the main weapon. The style was founded in Japan
about 500 years ago, in the Kanto area, in a place called Kashima. From the same
place many sword fighting schools have been initiated.

At the moment the style is being practised along with Japan, at Hawaii (USA), Belgium and Finland.
All practitioners are members of the [Japanese main organisation called
Shūtokukai (秀徳会)](http://www.jikishin-naginata.jp/ "Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu"),
which has the purpose of preserving and respecting the legacy of Jikishinkageryū Naginatajutsu.

Style specific characteristics are the circular cutting techniques named
after the wind- and watermills, in which the naginata can be in motion all the time.

In addition to naginata, the style also studies the use of tanto (short knife),
bokken (wooden sword) and kusarigama (chain attached to a sickle).

Jikishinkageryū belongs to the [Japanese organisation for classical styles,
Nihon Kobudō Kyōkai](http://www.nihonkobudokyoukai.org/martialarts/059/ "Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu - Nihon Kobudo Kyokai"),
which is a society recognised by the Japanese government for authenticating
the historical martial art styles.


## Koryu and Atarashii Naginata

By the end of the Meiji period in Japan, there were some ten styles left from the
vast 400 from Edo period. The two biggest styles were Tendōryū ja Jikishinkageryū,
both of which the main weapon is naginata. The head teachers of these two styles
initiated the work for what we now know as Atarashii Naginata.

The training outfits are somewhat identical with the one exception being the
tightening band in the sleeves, which is not present in the Jikishinkageryū
version. During the demonstrations, usually a black jacket is worn and its
sleeves are tied so they would not interfere with the action.

The practitioners of koryu are suggested to study Atarashii Naginata due to their
historical relations. Equally the students of Atarashii Naginata are encouraged to
study koryu after a minimum of a year of active experience in Atarashii Naginata.
